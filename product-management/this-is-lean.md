# This is Lean

## Chapter 1 - From resource focus to customer focus.

- Resource efficiency - using our resources as much as we can AND gaining value from them.
- Resource efficiency is natural. If we arenâ€™t using something we paid for, we are wasting money.
- Flow efficiency focuses on the unit processed.
- It is difficult, if not impossible, to have high flow and resource efficiency.

## Chapter 2 - Processes are central to flow efficiency.

- Flow efficiency is achieved through processes, or collections of activities that create the path and fulfill the need of the flow unit.
- Flow efficiency is about decreasing non-value-added and increasing value-added.
- Flow efficiency is defined from the point of view of the flow unit.
- You define system boundaries, which is when a flow unit begins and ends processing.
- Defining system boundaries help define throughput time which is used to calculate flow efficiency.
- It is important to distinguish between value-adding and non-value-adding activities.
- Value is determined by the need of the customer.
- Direct needs are about creating a concrete outcome; indirect needs are about creating an experience.
- Flow efficiency is the sum of value-adding activities in relation to throughput time.
- Value can be added according to direct and indirect needs.
- Flow efficiency is not about the speed of a value-adding activity, but what percent of the time is adding value versus not.
