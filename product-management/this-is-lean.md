# This is Lean

## Chapter 1 - From resource focus to customer focus.

- Resource efficiency - using our resources as much as we can AND gaining value from them.
- Resource efficiency is natural. If we aren’t using something we paid for, we are wasting money.
- Flow efficiency focuses on the unit processed.
- It is difficult, if not impossible, to have high flow and resource efficiency.

## Chapter 2 - Processes are central to flow efficiency.

- Flow efficiency is achieved through processes, or collections of activities that create the path and fulfill the need of the flow unit.
- Flow efficiency is about decreasing non-value-added and increasing value-added.
- Flow efficiency is defined from the point of view of the flow unit.
- You define system boundaries, which is when a flow unit begins and ends processing.
- Defining system boundaries help define throughput time which is used to calculate flow efficiency.
- It is important to distinguish between value-adding and non-value-adding activities.
- Value is determined by the need of the customer.
- Direct needs are about creating a concrete outcome; indirect needs are about creating an experience.
- Flow efficiency is the sum of value-adding activities in relation to throughput time.
- Value can be added according to direct and indirect needs.
- Flow efficiency is not about the speed of a value-adding activity, but what percent of the time is adding value versus not.

## Chapter 3 - What makes a process flow

- Little’s law states `throughputTime = flowUnitsInProcess x cycleTime`
- The law of bottlenecks states that throughout time is most impacted by the stage of the process that has the longest cycle time (or slowest flow)
- Process bottlenecks can move and pop up in different stages of the process after allocating more resources to fixing the bottleneck
- Bottlenecks can occur for two reasons:
    - Stages of a process must be done sequentially
    - Stages of a process vary in cycle time
- The reason for variation can be divided into three categories: resources, flow units, and external factors
- Regardless of the reason, variation will affect either processing time or arrival time
- Increased variation causes increased throughput time

## Chapter 4 - The efficiency paradox

- Source of Inefficiency 1: long throughput times
  - Resource-efficient processes cause long throughput times which cause secondary needs
- Source of inefficiency 2: many flow units
  - Handling too many flow units at once creates more secondary needs
  - Resource-efficient processes always need work to do
- Source of inefficiency 3: many restarts per flow unit
  - Context switching has a non-negligible cost
  - Handovers cause restarts for the flow unit. Unfortunately, processes where a single resource can handle all tasks required by a flow unit are rare
  - Handovers can cause a lack of responsibility/accountability. They can also cause an information loss
- Secondary needs consume resources, even if no real value is created in this superfluous work
- Just because you are working does not mean you are adding value. You can be doing superfluous work
- Efficiency paradox = focus on resource effiency → secondary needs → superfluous work → wasted resources
- Resolving efficiency paradox:
  - Decrease throughput time
  - Decrease number of flow units in process
  - Decrease the number of restarts

## Chapter 5 - Once upon a time... How Toyota became number one through customer focus

- Toyota’s production system is built on two pillars
  - Jidoka - automation with a human touch
  - Just in time - eliminate all inventory and give the customer only what they want
- The first effect of resource scarcity was to focus on “doing the right thing”
- The second effect of resource scarcity was the focus on “doing things right”
- Seven forms of waste
  - Overproduction
  - Waiting
  - Transportation
  - Inventory
  - Movement
  - Defective products

## Chapter 7 - What lean is not

- 3 problems with various definitions of lean
  - Problem 1: defined at different levels of abstraction
    - Lean is seen as everything from a philosophy to a system to a tool
    - Most uses of lean have been low levels of abstraction and then applied to many scenarios
    - Many organizations quick lean because it’s presented as a car manufacturing process rather than the why of the process
  - Problem 2: lean as a means instead of an end
    - The focus on the goal creates flexibility while the focus on the means creates limitations
    - Organizations see implementing Toyota’s methods and tools as the end rather than just a means
  - Problem 3: lean is everything that is good and everything good is lean
    - Lean is not perfect. It’s not a silver bullet. It’s a choice
